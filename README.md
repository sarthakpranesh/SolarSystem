# SolarSystem
Using Threejs to replicate Solar System with the actual proportion of planet size, spin, and orbit rotation.

Check live demo - https://solarsystemtoscale.vercel.app/

<br />

## Aim
- [x] Use actual size of all spatial bodies (obviously scaled down to fit in your screen)
- [x] Use actual spin speed of all spatial bodies (scaled down, due to their big size they spin really fast)
- [x] Use actual orbit rotation speed of all spatial bodies (scaled down)
- [x] Use actual (or similar) texture for all spatial bodies
- [x] Implement Orbit controls - to pan around, zoom in, zoom out, etc.
- [ ] Implement First Person controls

<br />

## Development
First install all packages then use the `dev` script to run the app
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
